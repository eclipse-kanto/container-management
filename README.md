# Eclipse Kanto - Container Management

![Coverage](https://github.com/eclipse-kanto/container-management/wiki/coverage.svg)

Eclipse Kanto Container Management adopts cloud-native concepts, approaches and specifications adapted in a
device-centric fashion achieving a lightweight pluggable management for containers at the edge. It is specially designed
to be lightweight and easily deployable on a wide range of edge devices and platforms to enable a secured, isolated and
reliable deployment mechanism and runtime for IoT applications developed in the most fit-for-purpose technology and
programming frameworks.

It abstracts the core containers lifecycle, state, networking, host resources access and usage management under a common
unified API that allows seamless integration with different underlying runtimes/engines - be that OCI-compliant ones (
e.g. containerd, runc, kata) or Linux-native such (e.g. LXC, LXD). The loosely coupled architecture of Eclipse Kanto
Container Management allows transparent pluggability on different levels, exchange and fine-grained configuration of its
internal components to fit fast to existing solutions as well as build up such from scratch.

Eclipse Kanto Container Management also provides digital twin modelling based on Eclipse Vorto models that enables remote
configuration, monitoring and management of containerized IoT applications at the edge.
